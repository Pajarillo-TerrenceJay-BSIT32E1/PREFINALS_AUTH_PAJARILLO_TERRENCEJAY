# Self-Assessment: Onion Architecture, MVC, and Web API (.NET Core) with Bottlenecks (Encountered)


# Conceptual Understanding:
* Onion Architecture: Yes, I am aware of the software design principle known as "Onion Architecture." This architectural pattern, whose layers are arranged like the layers of an onion, stresses the division of responsibilities inside an application. 

* MVC Pattern: Yes, I am aware of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. This software architecture design is frequently employed in web development, especially for creating user interfaces.

* Web API: No. I'm not familiar with building RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core Web APII.

# Application & Bottlenecks:
# Onion Architecture:

Benefits:

* Flexibility

* Testability

* Consistency

# Bottlenecks (Encountered):

* No, I haven't personally encountered any challenges with Onion Architecture in my projects.

# MVC:

# Components:

* Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application. It encapsulates the state and behavior of the application domain. Models are responsible for managing data persistence, validation, and business rules.

* View: Represents the presentation layer of the application. It's responsible for rendering the user interface and displaying data from the model to the user. Views are typically passive and reflect changes in the model.

* Controller: Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It receives user input from the view, processes it (often by invoking methods on the model), and updates the view accordingly. Controllers handle user interactions and orchestrate the flow of data between the model and the view.

# Bottlenecks (Encountered):

* No, I haven't encountered challenges with tight coupling between Model and Controller in MVC projects.

# Web API:

# Differences from MVC:

* While Web APIs are focused on supplying data and functionality over HTTP for consumption by client apps, traditional MVC applications are focused on producing HTML content for rendering in web browsers.

# Bottlenecks (Encountered)
  
* No, I haven't encountered performance challenges with traditional MVC applications compared to Web APIs.
